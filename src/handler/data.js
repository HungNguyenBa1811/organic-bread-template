        comment: `"Guess Who Is Back" - the mapset made by Sotarks (This is his 137th ranked map) and other mappers, most notably fieryrage, is a map where you have to "guess" who is back. The map really shines with the guessing the next note (which everyone knows is going to be vertically down or up), creating very interesting and interactive gameplay that no one has seen before. You can think of "Guess Who Is Back" as a completely different game, because you're gonna be guessing if you hit the jump or not. Facts don't lie, so doesn't the performance point system. I strongly believe that this map is the best map in this game. You might ask - why? You see, "Guess Who Is Back" is known for it's outstanding mapping, completely changing how mapping is done in year 2019. Well known mappers push their limits to create the best "PP" map, and this one is clearly the best "PP" map in the beatmap section of the game osu!.`
